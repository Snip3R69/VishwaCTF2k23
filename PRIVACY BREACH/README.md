DESCRIPTION:

Dude...They just emailed my own password back to me (and it wasn't even
asterisked) Don't they know that's a severe breach of privacy!!! Offenders leaked
them in PlainText. I hope they lie at the bottom of the deepest pits of hell Can you tell
me their domain name??

I read the description and I randomly started to search the terms mentioned in the
description and at a moment I googled the “plaintext offender leak” because the
description reads that the “offenders leaked them in plaintext.” and the first thing I
found is a website named plaintext offender I researched a bit and found this page
who’s link is (https://plaintextoffenders.com/page/114) . The caption further reads
that “I hope they lie at the bottom of the deepest pits” so I dig a bit deeper then it
found out an image that has an e-mail address.

The image that contains the e-mail address is:

Now as the description asked me to "find the domain name" and on this post there was this napcosecurity.com mentioned, so i simply submitted it as my flag and boom it worked! Tho before i tried a few without reading "the dippest pit" description which landed me nowhere.

```The final flag was: VishwaCTF{napcosecurity.com}```
