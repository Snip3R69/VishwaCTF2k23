Ronnie coleman has a message for you but you have to first arrange the weights
to get the message. Hint: Use a underscore between words for the flag.
In this question we were given four .wav files:

After analysing there files in Audacity, I got some horizontally sliced words,
which I joined using Paint.

After joining these images using Paint, I got some text “Gosqrd” and “Romnz”

But this lead me to nowhere and I concluded maybe this was just a RickRoll for us.
After reading 1st line of the question again, “Ronnie coleman has a message for you”
I tried searching about this guy Ronnie coleman, and he is a popular body builder.
Then I searched for some random terms like “Ronnie coleman messages” but nothing
came out, then I tried “Ronnie coleman best messages”.
This prompted me with some of his famous quotes,

I tried entering light_weight_yeah_budyy! in several ways but it was good for nothing,
Finally I tried entering light_weight and IT Workedddddd!!!

```Flag: VishwaCTF{light_weight}```
