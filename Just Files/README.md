It was a zip file with an audio file with wav format.

Its_a_Morse_not_a_joke_take_it_seriously.wav

The wav file had morse code which yielded the following :

```
R E V E R S E T H E A U D I O A N D Y O U S H O U L D F I N D N A M E O F P R O T A G O N I S T
. I T O L D Y O U T H A T S T O R Y I N P N G F I L E . E E I E I T E H E E E E E I A E I E E E E E E E E

T E E T E N E E E E II S
```

After reversing the audio. The audio was from the show Lucifer. There was only one name
taken and it was Lucifer. That was the name of the protagonist.

After using stegide on the wav file with the password “lucifer”. We get:

Nice
The flag is {the name of protagonist_S01E03}.

name of protagonist should be in small case.

With this we got the flag.
