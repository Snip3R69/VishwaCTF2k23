## DESCRIPTION
In my college level project I created this website that tells us if any domain/ip is active or not. But there is a catch.

## soln
Fumbling upon this challenge I tried whole lot of things like XSS, XSS to RCE and what not :/

And finally a simple dirsearch gave a txt file flag.txt

thats it. but lmao to be honest after the ctf i came to know that it was a whole chall for command injection.
